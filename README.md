# @bieb ![build](https://github.com/timseverien/bieb/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)

@bieb is a collection of JavaScript packages for creative coders who work in browsers or node.js.

## Packages

| Package | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [@bieb/box](./packages/box) | Math with boxes |
| [@bieb/post](./packages/post) | WebGL post processing in a separate WebGL context (useful for 2D canvas art) |
| [@bieb/vector](./packages/vector) | Vector math |

## Rationale

This repository is heavily inspired by [`@thi.ng/umbrella`](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella). Wheras `@thi.ng/umbrella` seems to focus on completion, @bieb aims to be easy to install and use and have a low footprint. Also, I get to reuse my own stuff and hopefully I’ll learn something.

## What the hell does bieb mean?

This is a library of stuff to support creative coders. Translating library to Dutch, we get ‘bibliotheek’ which is often shortened to ‘bieb’.
